This project features an AI that has learned to understand human emotions. It has done this by interpreting the hashtags people leave on social media platforms, a popular human method for categorizing images.

In this code you will find:

    A trained emotional model based on the hashtags which can be repurposed for whatever you require.
    A web-app written in javascript and jquery which enables you to test the model.
    A front-end interface to upload unseen images for categorization. This can also serve to train the model further if desired.
